## Normal Flow
1. Default positioning:
		position: relative
2. Elements is "in flow"
3. Elements are simply laid out according to their order in the HTML code.

## Absolute Positioning
1. Elements is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow"
		position: absolutu
2. No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them
3. We use top, bottom, left or right to offset the element from its relatively postioned container.

absolutu 用直接用 top, bottom, left, right 定位是相对于窗口视图。
所以应该相对别的元素直接定位。

## Floats
1. Element is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow"
2. Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element 
3. The container will not adjust its height to the element
